# Haramain-High-Speed-Rail
HHSR is a website that is developed to provide services for passengers between Makkah and Madina. It is a system that acts as a third party between the passengers and the railway managers. The main purpose of our system is helping the passengers to reserve a ticket for the haramain train to make sure that the passengers avoid further stress in waiting in the railway counters. The website concerns more than one train which passes among 5 stations which are Makkah, Madina, King Abdullah Economic City, King Abdulaziz International Airport, and center of Jeddah. The website displays all the available tickets between station to allow the user to reserve the required ticket after the registration with an option of update and cancel the reserved ticket. Also, users can pay the ticket online and send messages. The website is connected with a database that contains all the data about the users, trains, and tickets.
